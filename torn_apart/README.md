# Original example of a FastAPI application

## Credit

This original example is unashamedly stolen from the code within [this repository](https://github.com/wpcodevo/python_fastapi).

It spins up an API with JWT auth, and gives you a way to set up users with usernames and passwords, hashing their passwords, etc.

It also allows you to verify users via email.

This original example serves as the inspiration for everything else in this repository.
